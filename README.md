## This is a change from the 'master' branch.
Master branch update the read me.

# Short summary for Activity 1 Github Basics (setup, Repositories, Branching, Merging)

I created a repository called git-training and added a README.md file to initialize it. After cloning the repo to VSCode, I created a new branch named master using git checkout -b master. I edited the README.md file in the master branch by adding a new sentence, then switched back to the main branch to merge the changes using git merge master. I pushed the changes to GitHub using git push origin main, but didn’t initially see the master branch on GitHub. To fix this, I pushed the master branch with git push -u origin master. This exercise helped me understand how to create branches, make changes, merge them, and push updates to remote repositories.
